Feature: Download report
as a auditor
In order to view my docs
I want to be able to download a report


  # Scenario: download report
  #   Given there is a organization
  #   And S3 uploads are stubbed out
  #   And that I am logged in as a admin
  #   And there are documents with document_metas that match the filter
  #   And the reports are generated
  #   And I am on the admin reports page for organization
  #
  #   # TODO fix this to work with S3
  #   When I click the "Download Report" link
  #   Then I should receive the report file
  #   And the Report zip file should have documents in it
