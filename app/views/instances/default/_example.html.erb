                        <p>Welcome to CIDI 1010! I have been teaching this course for four years now, and I learn something new each semester. While this class is focused on creating a learning services agreement for teaching in higher education, I think you will find the principles will apply to many instructional contexts. I would like each student to create his or her own learning experience within the framework I have developed, so if you have ideas-- let's talk.</p>
                        <p>Please take the time to review this learning services agreement thoroughly. It has all the information you need to be successful in this course. After you have read this document, if any part of the course is unclear, please email me.</p>

Students will explore their instructional strengths and weaknesses as indicated by an inventory of their personal beliefs, knowledge and practices. Students will create a SALSA that identifies course: Information, Outcomes, Resources, Activities, Policies and Grades.
